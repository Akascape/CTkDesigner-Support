# What is CTkDesigner?

CTkDesigner is a no-code, drag and drop customtkinter designer application.
You just have to click on the widget to spawn it on the working window, then move it with the mouse, change parameters and export it to a python app.
After exporting, you can edit your ctk app easily like adding command and functions. CTkDesigner will simply save your time.

Available for: **Windows (.exe), MacOS (.app) and Linux**

## Why it's not free?
I made lots of customtkinter widget and made them free for everyone, but CTkDesigner took a lot of manual work and time, so consider this as a type of support if you buy this project from me.
