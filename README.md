# What is CTkDesigner?

CTkDesigner is a no-code, drag and drop customtkinter gui design application. (WYSIWYG: what you see is what you get).

You just have to click on the widget to spawn it on the working window, then move and place it with the mouse, change required parameters and export it to a python app.
After exporting, you can edit your python app easily, like adding commands, conditions and functions. _CTkDesigner will simply save your time._

Available for: **Windows (.exe)** only

### Note 
I made many customtkinter widgets and released them for free, but CTkDesigner took a lot of manual work and time, so consider this as a type of support if you are willing to buy this project from me.
There might be some minor bugs, but you can report it and I will try to fix it asap.
