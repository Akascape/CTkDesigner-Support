Here you can get the trial version, or report any issues of CTkDesigner, ask for features, qna, post templates etc.

# What is CTkDesigner?

CTkDesigner is a no-code, drag and drop customtkinter gui design application. (WYSIWYG: what you see is what you get).

You just have to click on the widget to spawn it on the working window, then move and place it with the mouse, change required parameters and export it to a python app.
After exporting, you can edit your python app easily, like adding commands, conditions and functions. _CTkDesigner will simply save your time._

**Available for:**
<br> ü™ü Windows 10/11 (.exe)
<br> üçé MacOSX (Catalina and later)

### Note from dev
I have developed made CustomTkinter widgets and made them available for free. However, CTkDesigner required significant manual effort and time to create. Please consider purchasing this project as a form of support if you are interested. While there may some minor bugs, you can report them, and I will address them as soon as possible. It is highly recommended to test the trial version before buying the official version.
