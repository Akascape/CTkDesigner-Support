**I highly recommend trying the trial version of CTkDesigner so that you can test the software and explore the possibilities of the app before buying the official version, 
but there are limitations in the trial version which I have added for obvious reasons.**

## DOWNLOAD TRIAL VERSION

Extract the zip file and run ctkdesigner.exe

## Limitations of the trial version:
- ✅ Time unlimited trial period
- ✅ Latest version
- ✅ Save/Load as templates
- ✅ Drag and move widgets
- ✅ Customise widgets
- ✅ Precise place method

- ❌ No external widgets
- ❌ No tooltips
- ❌ No popup menu
- ❌ No page feature
- ❌ No custom parameters

If you think you are comfortable with the ctkdesigner UI, then buy the original version and support me. 

Note: This app is packed using pyisnstaller so ignore if there is any detections shown by antiviruses, false positives are common with pyinstaller app, you can also try it in windows sandbox environment first, that's what I also do with any executables I download, still if you don't trust me then don't test/buy this software, thats it 😂
