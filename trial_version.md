**I highly recommend trying the trial version of CTkDesigner so that you can test the software and explore the possibilities of it before buying the official version, 
but there are limitations in the trial version which I added for obvious reasons.**

## DOWNLOAD TRIAL VERSION

Extract the zip file and run ctkdesigner.exe

<br> ✅ Time unlimited trial period
<br> ✅ Save/Load as templates
<br> ✅ Drag and move widgets
<br> ✅ Customise widgets
<br> ✅ Precise place method
<br> ✅ Core CTk widgets only
<br> ❌ No saving after loading templates
<br> ❌ No export to .py
<br> ❌ No theme editing
<br> ❌ No external widgets
<br> ❌ No tooltips
<br> ❌ No popup menu
<br> ❌ No page feature
<br> ❌ No custom parameters
<br> ❌ No offline documetation
<br> ❌ Missing functionalities

If you think you are comfortable with the ctkdesigner UI, then buy the original version and support me. 

Note: This app is packed using pyinstaller so ignore if there is any detections shown by antiviruses (which is rare), false positives are common issue with pyinstaller app (https://github.com/Akascape/CTkDesigner-Support/discussions/20), you can also try it in windows sandbox environment first, that's what I also do with any executables I download, still if you don't trust it then don't test/buy this software, no hard feelings 😊
